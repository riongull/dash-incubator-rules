# 1 Dash Incubator

[Dash Incubator](https://dashincubator.app/) is an open-source, blockchain-funded organization that redistributes [Dash](https://www.dash.org/) issued from [Superblocks](https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/governance/understanding.html) to users who produce open-source output that supports our [Mission](#11-mission) and [Vision](#12-dash-vision).

The Incubator uses a [Bounty](#2-bounties) system to fund and manage the end-to-end delivery of a wide variety of projects [proposed](#21-concepts) by the community, ranging from small [jobs](#22-bounty-types) such as bug bounties, to ongoing [services](#22-bounty-types) such as promotions or infrastructure provision, to mid-size development [projects](#22-bounty-types) such as dApps and development tools, to large development [programmes](#22-bounty-types) involving multiple products that need to be developed and launched together.

Fund allocation and management is decentralized across [Admin](#4-admins) users and [Strategists](#46-strategists).

The Incubator is a [Dash Funded Organization (DFO)](#14-full-transparency).  All internal operations of the Incubator are conducted in the public domain at all times.  This includes how work is proposed, selected, specified, developed, tested, approved, which users are completing or managing work, what rewards they are allocating or receiving and all internal decision making and governance.

All work produced by the Incubator, known as Output, is open-source and licensed under MIT License.

All handling and allocation of Incubator [funds](#5-funds) can be publicly verified down to [user-task](#25-tasks) level via the [Dash Blockchain](#53-auditing) in realtime.

## 1.1 Mission

Our mission is to find, support and fund the most promising developers and entrepreneurs to build and grow the most innovative and user-friendly applications that maximize the usecases and utility of Dash.

## 1.2 Dash Vision

Our vision is to grow Dash to become the number one cryptocurrency for everyday payments by constantly innovating the fastest, easiest-to-use and most cost-effective digital cash at global scale.

## 1.3 Strategy

Strategy in the Incubator is defined by each individual Incubator [Strategist](#46-strategists).  Each Strategist aims to achieve our overall [Mission](#11-mission) and [Dash Vision](#12-dash-vision).

The Incubator's roadmap is the collection of Strategist [Bounty](#2-bounties) priorities as stated in the most recent [Proposal](#64-proposals).

## 1.4 Full-Transparency

To ensure that the Incubator's processes and information remain fully open-source and encourage the same standard for other DFOs in Dash, we introduce the following criteria for an **Open-Source DFO** classification that the Incubator implements:

1. All funding receipts and expenditure are tracked
2. All work systems and their data are public
3. All work preparation and pricing is public
4. All work output is public
5. All people's work and rewards are public and verifiable
6. All rules governing the Incubator and decisions on how to maintain those rules are public

## 1.5 Users

There are several types of Incubator users, as follows:

- Users - anyone who accesses the Incubator or its underlying data
- Members - any user who has signed up to the Incubator
- [Contributors](#3-contributing) - Members who create output for the Incubator
- [Admins](#4-admins) - Members with rights to manage Bounties accepted by Strategists.
- [Strategists](#46-strategists) - Admins who manage and report on Budgets
- [Lead Strategist](#47-lead-strategist) - The strategist who raises Proposals to the Dash network on behalf of the Incubator 

> Currently all Members can be found as the members of our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/FPJzDcok/dash-incubator-app)

## 1.6 Network Contract

This document contains the Rules that define the terms between [Dash Incubator](#1-dash-incubator) and the [Dash Network](https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/governance/understanding.html#) for how any funding awarded to the Incubator by the Network will be used.

When coupled with Incubator's [full transparency](#14-full-transparency) policy, anyone can trustlessly audit how well the Incubator is meeting the commitments of these terms in realtime, including verifying the use of all funding via the Dash blockchain itself down to a user/task level.

We refer to the transparent implementation of the terms defined in this document in return for the funding provided from Dash Network as the Network Contract.

The Incubator is required to abide by the Network Contract at all times.

The authoritative source for the Rules are contained in a single document hosted on [Github](https://github.com/DashIncubator/dash-incubator-rules/blob/master/rules.md), with updates to the Rules (enacted as merged commits to the master branch) taking effect immediately.

## 1.7 Legal

The Incubator is not a legal entity and as such doesnâ€™t own any assets, including any rights to any output, nor does the Incubator apply any restrictions on contributor's usage of their own Task output, apart from the requirement that all output must be open-sourced under MIT license.

The only funding the Incubator receives is in the form of Dash tokens issued directly from the Dash blockchain, which it redistributes to users who provide verifiable open-source output for predefined tasks approved by Admins, who agree to operate in accordance with the Rules defined in this document.

The Incubator does not handle, hold or pay fiat currency and all rewards are issued in Dash tokens as incentives for creating some open-source output, at the sole discretion of Incubator Admins, and without any agreement or action to purchase or procure any assets, intellectual property or labor.

# 2 Bounties

A Bounty in the Incubator means a collection of work that can be completed by contributors for a reward, such as development or promotion of Dash or of the Incubator itself.

Bounties are first proposed as Concepts by the community, and there are four [types](#22-bounty-types) of Bounty that can be funded, each containing a series of [Tasks](#22-bounty-types) that are managed by the Bounty's [Admin](#4-admins), who earn a % commission of all rewards that the Bounty generates.

## 2.1 Concepts

All Bounties start as a Concept that is [proposed](#31-proposing-concepts) to the Incubator by a community member.

Concepts are proposals for some work that the Incubator should fund as a Bounty, that provide enough detail about the value proposition and requirements of the work to enable Contributors to complete it.

[Strategists](#46-strategists) create a Bounty for each Concept they accept that they then own, meaning they have the rights to manage and earn commission from its delivery.  They [accept](#434-processing-task-claims) Concepts that meet our [Concept Acceptance Criteria](#411-concept-acceptance-criteria) on a first-come first-serve basis.  Once accepted, the user who created the Concept is assigned as a [Stakeholder](#25-bounty-stakeholders) of the corresponding bounty.

## 2.2 Bounty Types

When a Bounty is created from a [Concept](#21-concepts) by a [Strategist](#46-strategists), they assign one of four types for the new Bounty that determine how work will be structured:

- **Projects** develop products such as a decentralized apps built on Dash (dApps), tools for the community or improvements to the Dash Protocol itself.
- **Services** provide ongoing work that involves provision of some service, such as website hosting, code maintenance, or a recurring requirement for servicing the Incubator itself.
- **Jobs** are one-off pieces of work, such as finding bugs or fixing a github issue.
- **Programmes** are collections of Project, Service or Job Bounties that coordinate large pieces of work.

> All Bounties in the Incubator are represented by a Card on our [Trello Board](#https://trello.com/b/FPJzDcok/dash-incubator-app). The Bounty's type is represented by the column the Card is in on the Board.  Meta Bounties are shown with the pink label on the Card's front cover.

## 2.3 Bounty Status

Each Bounty can be set to have one of the following Statuses at any time:

- **Active** - The Bounty is in progress any Tasks can be created, edited or completed
- **Paused** - The Bounty is on-hold and no Tasks can be created, edited or completed
- **Completed** - The Bounty is archived and no changes can be made.

## 2.4 Bounty Stakeholders

For some bounties, Admins may wish to regularly solicit the views of subject area experts or other key stakeholders as part of the decision making process when defining bounty tasks. 

Whilst bounty administration remains under the Admins of the bounty, a record of these Stakeholders, the nature of their interest, and the circumstances under which they should be consulted, may be added to the Bounty data.

[Concept](#21-concepts) creators are automatically added as Stakeholders of any Bounty that derives from the Concept.

> On Trello, the stakeholder usernames are added to the Card's description in a Stakeholders section, including any additional information on the context for their involvement.

## 2.5 Tasks

A Task is the basic unit-of-work in the Incubator and represents a unit of open-source output that a user can produce for a specified reward.

All work in the Incubator, and consequently any use of funds, is performed via completion of a Task by a user, or the management of that Task by an [Admin](#4-admins), within a specific Bounty.

Tasks are defined by Admins and can be completed by any user after [reserving](#33-reserving-tasks) the tasks with the Admin, or in the case of [Job](#22-bounty-types) tasks, completed without reservation.

Each Task must define some quantifiable Output (a document, commit, etc) that a user can produce to be eligible to [Claim](#26-claims) the specified reward.

There are four types of Task available within the Incubator:

- [Concept Tasks](#251-concept-tasks) - the initial creation of a Concept that results in the creation of a new Bounty
- [Specification Tasks](#252-specification-tasks) - work that provides the detail necessary to define Production Tasks
- [Production Tasks](#253-production-tasks) - work related to Tasks required to complete Project, Service and Job bounties
- [QA Tasks](#254-qa-tasks) - work that assures the quality of Production Tasks

> Each Task Type is represented as a named Checklist on the Bountyâ€™s Trello Card, except for Concept Tasks, which are implicitly completed when a Concept is Accepted by an Admin.

### 2.5.1 Concept Tasks

A Concept Task is defined as the [submission of new Concept](#31-proposing-concepts) by an Incubator user.

The [Claim](#34-claiming-tasks) for a Concept Reward is considered to be implicit and approved as soon as a Strategist [accepts](#41-accepting-concepts) the Concept.

### 2.5.2 Specification Tasks

Specification Tasks define how [Production Tasks](#253-production-tasks) should be completed and [QA'd](#254-qa-tasks).

The output is usually a document such as a Design Requirements doc, Functional Specification, or any resource that enables output relating to achieving the Value Proposition of the Bounty to be produced effectively.

Admins measure the quality of the Specification in terms of its fitness for purpose and adequate detail level to define the Production Tasks a [Contributor](#15-users) needs to implement it.

### 2.5.3 Production Tasks

Production Tasks are the actual output of a Bounty that deliver the value proposition. 

Usually Production Tasks output some code or a working product, but if the Bounty is for example a research project, the Production Tasks could output documents or analysis, or any format that satisfies the goals of the Bounty.

### 2.5.4 QA Tasks

Quality Assurance tasks validate and test that [Production Tasks](#253-production-tasks) meet their [Specification](#252-specification-tasks).

Most Production Tasks should require related QA tasks, and Specifications should include a QA plan to provide a clear and easy way to measure how well a Production Task meets its spec when the QA is performed.

QA Tasks must reference the relevant Specification or Production Task and produce some QA report output.

> It is recommended to use the [QA Report Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FCIPJTGGNe-bmjEadO1QtJIvNI5L93Dgv0UeJ6lJzaM/edit) unless the admin requests an alternative format.

## 2.6 Claims

A Claim is the process of a user signalling that they have completed a [Task](#25-tasks) and wish to receive the Task's stated reward.

Users can create Claims for Tasks they believe to be complete from the [Admin](#4-admins) who owns the Task using the [Claims process](#34-claiming-tasks).

Once a Task Claim is approved by an Admin, the Task Reward will be awarded to the Dash address the claimant specified in the Claim within 7 days.

## 2.7 Rewards

The Incubator is a pure Dash fund, meaning all rewards are priced and paid in DASH units.

Admins can price tasks up to the max price.  Strategists can claim a commission up to the max commission listed in the table below.  They can either keep the full claimed [reward](#44-admin-rewards) or split it with a non-Strategist admin who has assisted in the administration process.

### 2.7.1 Price List

<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Task Type</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Approval Criteria</strong>

</table>

# 3 Contributing

Contributing to the Incubator involves completing [Tasks](#25-tasks) on [Bounties](#2-bounties) to earn [Rewards](#27-rewards).

A reward can also be earned by proposing a Concept for new Bounties that get accepted by a [Strategist](#46-strategists).

All work produced at the Incubator must be open-sourced under MIT license before any rewards can be paid, to satisfy the Incubator's [full-transparency](#14-full-transparency) requirements.

## 3.1 Proposing Concepts

Anyone can create a [Concept](#21-concepts) by signing up to the Incubator and submitting a [New Concept Template](https://trello.com/c/6XAuy9DW/94-request-new-concept).

Any [Strategist](#46-strategists) can [accept](#434-processing-task-claims) a Concept that meets our [Concept Acceptance Criteria](#411-concept-acceptance-criteria), meaning they create a new [Bounty](#2-bounties) for it that they become the owner of.

The [Concept Reward](#271-price-list) is paid to the Dash address listed in the Concept when accepted.

>- To propose a Concept, add a comment on the [New Concept Card](https://trello.com/c/6XAuy9DW/94-request-new-concept) on Trello.  
>- To chat with Admins about a Concept or its acceptance, join the [DashDevs Discord](https://discord.gg/mU79ZWx) and ask on the #dash-incubator channel.

## 3.2 Completing Job Tasks

Job Tasks on Bounties are open to be claimed by anyone without needing to reserve the task.

To claim a reward on a Job task, use the [Claims process](#34-claiming-tasks)

## 3.3 Reserving Tasks

Any tasks other than Jobs can be reserved.  This means that you can agree with the Task's Admin to have exclusive rights to claim the Task until the due date.  

To reserve a task, leave a comment for the Admin of the Bounty that the Task is a part of, so that they can assign the task to you, and/or discuss the Task details and negotiate the reward.

Once you have completed the Task, use the [Claims process](#34-claiming-tasks) to claim the reward.

If a claim isn't made by the due date, the Admin can extend the date, or has the option to cancel the reservation.

> To be able to Reserve a Task please join as a Member of our Trello Board by leaving a comment on our [Member Signup Card](https://trello.com/c/VlpK4dgl/95-member-signup).

## 3.4 Claiming Tasks

Once you have completed the work for a Task you can make a [Claim](#26-claims) for the reward on the Task, by providing the following information:

1. Link to the source for the tasks output (specific PR or commit for Github code)
2. Link to any deploy links relevant to the output (e.g. a URL for a website)
3. Specify a valid Dash address to receive the reward, or set to [NULL](#341-null-claims) to decline the reward.

Once your Claim has been created it will [processed](#434-processing-task-claims) by an admin.

> To create a Claim on Trello, leave a comment on the Bounty's [Trello Card](https://trello.com/b/FPJzDcok/dash-incubator-app) specifying the number and type of the Task you are claiming, along with the source links and your Dash address

### 3.4.1 Null Claims

In some cases, users wish to decline rewards for some reason.

This is strongly discouraged as incentives are how Incubator maintains a high level of creativity, productivity, and quality of output, and Claims themselves are how we track and account for work completion.

However, to support the requirement, we introduced the option to create a Null Claim.

Therefore users who wish to decline rewards still need to make a Claim to signify and enable tracking of a Task's completion, but they can set the claim's Dash address to 'NULL' to signify that the actual reward is declined and therefore won't be awarded.

> To create a Null Claim in Trello, simply enter the term 'NULL' in place of a Dash address on the relevant [Claim comment](#42-claiming-tasks).

# 4 Admins

Admins are users in the Incubator who are authorized and permitted to manage [Bounties](#2-bounties) in the Incubator. [Strategists](#46-strategists) are a subset of Admins who assume extra responsibilities, and can carry out all Admin actions. All [Bounties](#2-bounties) must be [originally accepted](#41-accepting-concepts) and [owned](#422-bounty-ownership) by a Strategist, but Admins can perform most administrative [Bounty Management](#42-bounty-management) actions.

> On Trello, the board is configured to only allow Admins to create and edit cards, including defining and assigning tasks to Board members. Any user can comment on cards to interact with Admins about the bounties they're managing.

## 4.1 Accepting Concepts

Bounties are created via the Acceptance of a user-submitted [Concept](#31-concepts) by a [Strategists](#46-strategists).

 - A Bounty is only created from a Concept approval, and all Bounties must refer back to a single Concept
 - Any Strategist can Accept a new Concept but must first validate that it meets our [Concept Acceptance Criteria](#411-concept-acceptance-criteria)
 - Strategists do not need permission from or consensus between other Admins to accept a Concept
 - Strategists can submit new Concepts themselves, but need another Strategist to Accept them.
 - Once a Concept is Accepted, an implicit Claim for the Concept Task reward is considered to be approved automatically

> - In Trello, Admins formally Accept a Concept by [creating a new Bounty](#421-creating-bounties) for the Concept and linking it in a reply to the user's comment on the [New Concept Card](https://trello.com/c/6XAuy9DW/94-request-new-concept) card.
> - The Admin should also add an entry to the [Incubator Accounting Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mhXlo4ylqWLLSYN4MGiLWlp7Gq3jrsDt0kB701dwMNU/edit#gid=0), using the user's details and Dash address from the Concept they submitted

### 4.1.1 Concept Acceptance Criteria

Strategists must judge that Concepts they wish to accept meet all of the following criteria:

1. Provide a clear Value Proposition that can return value to Dash that's inline with our [Dash Vision](#12-dash-vision)
2. Provide enough detail on requirements to enable a Bounty to achieve the stated goals
3. Be technically feasible using the current Dash Protocol or some unreleased but known iteration of it
4. Be unique within the existing set of Concepts & Bounties already added to the Incubator, i.e. not a duplicate or very similar scope to an existing active Bounty
5. Be achievable in terms of costs compared to the Incubator's current funding levels

## 4.2 Bounty Management

### 4.2.1 Creating Bounties

Bounties are created exclusively by Strategists who [Accept](#434-processing-task-claims) a community-submitted Concept and consequently receive [Ownership](#422-bounty-ownership) of the Bounty.  Strategists can either administer the bounty themselves, or delegate administrative work to a separate Admin.

Admins must ensure the following information is correctly configured on new Bounties that they create:

1. The creator of the Bounty is set as the [Owner](#422-bounty-ownership) Admin of the Bounty
2. The correct [Type](#22-bounty-types) for the Bounty is selected field (either Project, Specification, Job or Programme)
3. The Concept the Bounty was created from is linked in the Concept Doc field
4. The Description text reflects the Value Proposition of the related Concept
5. The Concept creator is listed as a [Stakeholder](#25-bounty-stakeholders)

> In Trello, Bounty ownership is designated by assigning the Admin user as the Member of the card on the top left below the card title.  When two Admins are assigned to the card, the assistant Admin is designated by putting their Trello username into the assistant Admin field on the card.

### 4.2.2 Bounty Ownership

The Strategist who created a Bounty is considered the owner of that Bounty and has priority rights to edit the Bounty's fields, define Tasks and process resulting Claims, and change the Bounty's [Status](#23-bounty-status). The Strategist may transfer ownership to another Strategist at any time.

> In Trello, Ownership is determined by the Admin who is a Member of the Card and who's username isn't specified in the assistant Admin field.  

### 4.2.3 Assistant Admins

The Strategist can optionally appoint an assistant Admin to the Bounty, enabling a maximum of two Admins to manage a bounty at one time. Assistant admins can edit the Bounty's details and carry out all administrative actions, but the Bounty is owned by the Strategist.  Assistant Admin rewards are described in [Admin Rewards](#44-admin-rewards).

> In Trello, Bounty Owners can appoint an assistant on a Card by entering their name in the assistant Admin field and assigning them as a Member of the Card. 

## 4.3 Task Management

### 4.3.1 Creating Tasks

Admins can create [Tasks](#25-tasks) on any Bounty that they own or are an Assistant Admin on.  When creating a Task, the Admin sets the Description, which must provide enough information to allow a Contributor to complete the work, either in the description itself or by linking a Specification.

The due-date is the date whereby if a [Claim](#26-claims) is not made for the Task, the Admin has the option to cancel the task or cancel any reservation at the Admin's discretion.

> When defining a Task in Trello, the Admin will chose the correct Checklist for the task type, and specify the following information:
>1. A Task number, which is the sequential number of the Task in the relevant Checklist
>2. A Description, summarising the broad requirements by a short definition is needed, and a link to a Specification to provide further detail if needed.
>3. An amount of Dash for the Reward.  This can be [negotiated](#432-pricing-tasks) between the Admin and prospective users
>5. A due-date and Task assignee
>
> This information should be entered into the Task description in the following format:
>
>```[taskNumber]) [taskDescription] ([amount] DASH)```

### 4.3.2 Pricing Tasks

Pricing Tasks in the Incubator takes a different and more flexible approach to traditional methods of sourcing as it factors in externalities such as priority, time constraints, skills availability (or overheads due to sourcing additional resources) and productivity incentives, whilst factoring out notions that ignore these factors such as fixed hourly-rates, market-rates or salary-based arrangements that won't necessarily achieve our goals at the speed we want or with the level of productivity we want to achieve for the value we want to deliver.

For example, if Tasks are urgent or highly specialized and resources are not available, or Tasks have existed for a long time without uptake, higher rewards can be set to achieve uptake on the Tasks, including the option to offer rewards for promoting those Tasks and/or placing the necessary resources, which can result in reward levels above traditional "market rates" to deliver the output we want in the time needed.

On the other hand, low priority tasks with multiple resources already on-boarded and available who could under-bid each other and without time-constraints can often provide output well below "market rates".

In other words, Tasks should be priced via a process to discover what is the minimum reward level needed to incentivize a Contributor to deliver something and deciding whether externalities such as needing to find & onboard the necessary resources or meet a certain deadline need to be factored in based on the Bounty's priority.

Fiat prices should be taken into consideration when a Task is created, but Tasks shouldn't be repriced if the fiat value changes unless not doing so would prevent completion of the Task.

### 4.3.3 Reserving Tasks

Except for [Job](#22-bounty-types) Bounty types, Admins must reserve Tasks to a specific user for the Task to be considered Active.

Admins can arrange reservations and negotiate the Task's terms with the user within the comments or via private communication, but once the Task is reserved to the user, the terms are considered agreed and are public information.

> On Trello, Tasks are represented by Checklists on the Bounty's Card, and are reserved by setting the Member setting to the user who reserved the Task and setting a date in the Due Date field.

### 4.3.4 Processing Task Claims

When a user completes a Task, they create a [Claim](#26-claims) that the Admin needs to process to decide if the Claim can be Approved, if QA is needed, or if there are issues that need to be resolved.

Approved Claims on Tasks go into the [Incubator Accounting Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mhXlo4ylqWLLSYN4MGiLWlp7Gq3jrsDt0kB701dwMNU/edit#gid=0) from which the reward will be sent to the claimant.

If a Contributor wants to dispute a Claim decision, they can ask for a second opinion from the other Admin on the Bounty or the Lead Strategist.

Ultimately, decisions on whether some output meets the requirements specified in the Task definition are the sole discretion of the Strategist that owns the Bounty.

> In Trello, Admins can Approve a Claim by ticking the Task's Checkbox and leaving a comment on the Bounty card as follows:
>
>```Claim Approved: [@username][checklistName]([taskIds])([amount] Dash)```
>
>For example:
>
>```Claim Approved: @somedev Production Tasks (1,2) (1 Dash)```
>
>Admins must then enter the details into the [Incubator Accounting Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mhXlo4ylqWLLSYN4MGiLWlp7Gq3jrsDt0kB701dwMNU/edit#gid=0), filling in all columns and double checking the userâ€™s payment address and reward amount, to enable the claim to be awarded.

## 4.4 Admin Rewards

Admins are rewarded with a commission based on approved task claims.  In addition, the Lead Strategist is awarded with a commission based on delegated budgets.

### 4.4.1 Strategist Rewards

Each quarter all Strategists submit a proposal with that quarter's monthly budget request to the Lead Strategist.  The Lead Strategist uses this as a basis for their request from the Incubator general budget as well as for how much to request from the network.  Admins are rewarded as follows:

- The Lead Strategist is awarded a [commission](#441-commissions) on approved Strategist budgets.
- Strategists (including the Lead Strategist) are awarded a [commission](#441-commissions) on approved tasks on Bounties they own.
- Assistant Admins, when used, are awarded a portion of the Strategist commission.

Sample requests and reward calculations are shown in the [Incubator Budget Model Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Utke_pYRNeqxygF1KsAakI3hwP0IX68QUDujpthIlq8/edit#gid=201630329).  Note that the spreadsheet model and values can change over time and may not represent any real particular budget depending on when the sheet is accessed.

Current approved reward values are found in the [Price List](#27-rewards) and [commission table](#441-commissions).

Admins can assign, complete, and claim Bounty Tasks for themselves, provided they carry out this process as usual and explictily assign themselves to the task for clear auditing purposes.

Commission rewards don't require formal claims, they are implicit claims recorded with their associated work Tasks in the [Incubator Accounting Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mhXlo4ylqWLLSYN4MGiLWlp7Gq3jrsDt0kB701dwMNU/edit#gid=0).

Note that Admins can also opt to decline rewards by creating a [Null Claim](#341-null-claims) on their commision within a Task Claim.

> To set a Null Claim on their Commission Reward, an Admin should enter their Dash address as 'NULL' in the Claim in the [Incubator Accounting Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mhXlo4ylqWLLSYN4MGiLWlp7Gq3jrsDt0kB701dwMNU/edit#gid=0)

</table>

## 4.5 Governance

[Strategists](#46-strategists) are responsible for governance and the strategic direction of the Incubator.  They collectively form a group referred to as the strategic committee.

The Strategic Committee is responsible to:

- Approve or reject Incubator rule changes (updates to this document).
- Approve or reject quarterly budget requests from the Lead Strategist.
- Remove any Admin other than the [Lead Strategist](#47-lead-strategist).
- Appoint a new Lead Strategist when the current Lead Strategist steps down.

Simple majority support is required for any of the above, meaning >50% of voting Strategists.  Strategists may recuse themselves from voting by not registering a vote (within an agreed voting period) or selecting/commenting â€˜Recuseâ€™ against the vote itself.

## 4.6 Strategists

Strategists are [Admins](#4-admins) who define and execute strategies for achieving the Incubator's [mission](#11-mission) and [vision](#12-dash-vision).  They ensure that the Incubator as a whole is delivering value to the Dash network.

Each Strategist submits a quarterly proposal to the [Lead Strategist](#47-lead-strategist) identifying priorites, updates, budget requests, etc related to the projects they own.  The Lead Strategist uses these proposals to help form the Incubator's main [funding proposal](#51-proposals).

Strategists may also carry out the following:

- Appoint new Admins to the Incubator.
- Add existing Admins as Assistant Admins on Bounties they own.
- Accept new Concepts and thus create new Bounties in the Incubator.

## 4.7 Lead Strategist

The Lead Strategist is the [Admin](#4-admins) who writes and submits [Proposals](#64-proposals) to the Dash Network on behalf of the Incubator, and handles (but isn't liable for) custody and transactions of the Dash received on behalf of Admins.

The Lead Strategist agrees to use funds solely for the purposes of awarding [Strategist Budgets](#522-strategist-budgets) and [Admin Task Claims](#26-claims).

The Lead Strategist may also carry out the following:

 - Promote Admins to Strategists.
 - Approve or reject Strategist budget requests.

The Lead Strategist can be replaced by masternode approval through a 1 DASH superblock proposal where the proposed new Lead Strategist is named and proves control over the proposal payout address.  The normal passing criteria for funding proposals must be achieved to be considered valid.  If that occurs, all funds under the Lead Strategist's control must be transferred to the address given in the proposal.  The new Lead Strategist assumes the role upon receipt of those funds.

# 5 Funds

The Incubator is fully transparent about all incoming and all outgoing funds.  Funds are received through proposals, managed through budgets, and spent through Bounties.

## 5.1 Proposals

There are two types of proposals in the Incuabtor:

- Network proposals from the Lead strategist to the Dash Network
- Strategist proposals from each Strategist to the Lead Strategist

### 5.1.1 Network Proposals

The Incubator is funded from a series of [Proposals](#64-proposals) submitted to the [Dash Network](https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/governance/understanding.html) on a quarterly basis.  The Lead Strategist submits this proposal, which is informed by the collection of Strategist Proposals.

The amount requested might vary to target the general scale and buffer that Strategists, including the [Lead Strategist](#47-lead-strategist), feel the Incubator needs.  When certain projects arise that require significant funding, individual proposals should be raised detailing the value proposition and estimated costs of those projects individually.

### 5.1.2 Strategist Proposals

Each Strategist submits quarterly proposals to the Lead Strategist to increase their budgets.  The content and purpose of this proposal is similar to the Lead Strategist's Network Proposal.  It should report project updates, value propositions, budget spending, quarterly priorities, and anything else the strategist wants to commmunicate in order to help justify the value delivered to the network for the funding received and requested.

## 5.2 Budgets

There are two types of budgets in the Incuabtor:

- The Incubator general budget
- Individual stategist budgets

### 5.2.1 General Budget

Network proposal funds are received to the published [Incubator Wallet](#63-accounting) address(es) and pooled across proposals as a rolling budget available to Strategist budgets.

The Incubator is a pure Dash fund meaning that rewards are denominated only in Dash.  Therefore any fluctuations in the fiat price of Dash will only reflect the pricing of new [Tasks](#25-tasks) by Admins and prior agreements made in Dash are not necessarily renegotiated or adjusted.

### 5.2.2 Strategist Budgets

Approved Strategist proposal funds are sent by the Lead Strategist to a distinct address for each Strategist.  These addresses are currently controlled by the Lead Strategist, but when the system matures and Strategists agree to it, the Lead Strategist will instead send funds to addresses each Strategist controls and these rules and processes will be updated accordingly.

Each Strategist's published address(es) carries funds in a rolling budget, similar to the general budget.  Strategists have full autonomy over their budget spending, so long as they serve the Incubator's vision and mission, and are accounted for according to the [auditing rules](#53-auditing).

When a Strategist leaves or is removed from the Incubator their budget is returned to the General Budget.

## 5.3 Auditing

Anyone can perform a full public audit (#14-full-transparency) of the Incubator at any time to check that all work is being conducted as per these Rules, and verify the rewards issued to individual Incubator users for that work via the Dash blockchain.

### 5.3.1 Auditing Accounts

All spending by the Incubator is tracked via [Task Claims](#26-claims) approved by [Admins](#4-admins), with associated transactions accounted for in the [Incubator Accounting Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mhXlo4ylqWLLSYN4MGiLWlp7Gq3jrsDt0kB701dwMNU/edit?usp=sharing).

- The Balance tab shows all incoming funds and compares it with all approved Task Claims and the current blockchain balance. 
- The Claims tab lists transaction ids for all rewarded claims which can be parsed to verify the reward amounts.

### 5.3.2 Auditing Work

All work must be conducted inline with the Rules in this document and in the public domain.  Therefore anyone can audit how well the work being conducted in the Incubator is adhering to these rules at any time.

As a guideline, the following aspects of work are key areas to ensure the Rules are being implemented effectively.

 - Admins are pricing work fairly
 - Admins are interpreting the rules effectively
 - Concepts being approved are inline with our [Mission](#11-mission) and [Vision](#12-dash-vision)
 - Quality of output is sufficient for rewards
 - Task deadlines and due dates are being managed effectively
